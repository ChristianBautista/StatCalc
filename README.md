# StatCalc
This application analyzes inputted match/game data and outputs a overall statline for each player/team. The **input** file must be a `csv` file. The program will write the calculated statistics into a file named `stats.csv`. **NOTE:** If an existing file in the same directory as `StatCalc.exe` is named `stats.csv`, the program may **overwrite** any data in this file. Below is a list of supported sports with their corresponding valid fields as well as instructions and guidelines on how to properly run and use the application.
